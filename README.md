This project mainly provides the default `Lua` grammar for `VSCode`. If you have any troubles or suggestions, please feel free to open issues.

## Change to VSCode
Due to the version release rules of VSCode, changes may take a longer period to enter VSCode.  
Until then you can temporarily install this extension to apply the latest changes: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua-grammar
